# Payment Methods

Currently we support payments via Invoice or Credit Card. Before you can start to create projects you must add a payment method in the [panel menu](https://panel.meshcloud.io/#/customer/paymentMethods).

If you want to receive written invoices for your project payments please [submit a request](https://support.meshcloud.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us and we will enable this service for you.

## Removing Payment Methods

Before you can delete a payment method it must first be removed from all associated projects. Usually you add a new payment methods, change
all project to this method and then the delete button is enabled to remove it.
