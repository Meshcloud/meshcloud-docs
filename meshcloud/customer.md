# Meshcloud Customer Management

## What is a Meshcustomer?

A Meshcustomer is automatically created for you when you [sign up](profile.md) for a new account. A Meshcustomer usually represents your Company. On a customer you manage multiple [projects](project.md), manage your users and their access rights and maintan general data like addresses and payment methods.

## Invite users to access a Meshcustomer

If you would like to give others access to your Meshcustomer and the related Meshprojects, go to your "Account" settings. You access them by pressing the settings icon on the top right of the panel. From here, navigate to "Users" and provide the full name as well as the email address of that person under "Pending Invitations". Press "+" to send an invitation email to this person. This step is necessary in order to give a user access to your [projects](project.md).

## Remove users from a Meshcustomer

If you would like to remove a user from your customer go to your "Account" settings and select "Users". If the user already accepted the invitation, you can click the "trash" icon in the "Users" section to remove the user from your Meshcustomer. If the user didn't claim the invitiation yet, you have to click the "trash" icon in the Pending Invitations section. When removing the user on the Meshcustomer, the user is automatically removed from all projects he had access to. He also won't be able to access cloud resources of your projects anymore.
