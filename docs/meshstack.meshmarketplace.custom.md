The [OSB Spec](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#service-object) provides a field `metadata` for services. Any custom metadata can be set in that metadata object. Some metadata is defined via a [convention](meshstack.meshmarketplace.profile.md#catalog-metadata), but additional metadata is allowed. By providing additional metadata here, the meshMarketplace will interpret them and provide specific functionality for these services. Metadata described in the following sections is currently supported.

## Custom Service Broker Features

### Sensitive Service Broker

Usually the meshMarketplace shows credentials of a Service Binding to the users, who have access to it. If the Service Broker requires a more secure handling of credentials, it can provide the `sensitive` metadata for the according service in the OSB catalog.

```json
{
  "services": [{
    "id": "acb56d7c-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-feb140a59a66",
    "name": "fake-service",
    "metadata": {
      "sensitive": true
    }
  }]
}
```

The meshMarketplace does not store any credentials provided by bindings on sensitive services. Instead, the meshMarketplace will only offer the credentials for download during the initial creation of the binding. The precondition for this to work is, that the creation of the binding is synchronous. Async bindings are not supported for sensitive services.

### Tenant-Aware Service Broker

A Service Broker can define its services to be tenant-aware by providing a `tenantAware` flag in service metadata of the service definition. Tenant-aware Service Broker are special Service Bindings that provide the tenant context to the Service Broker. When users create a tenant service binding in the meshMarketplace, they have to select a tenant. Only tenants of the meshProject the Service Instance lives in can be selected.

#### Configuration in Service Catalog

In the service catalog it would like this:

```json
{
  "services": [{
    "id": "acb56d7c-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-feb140a59a66",
    "name": "my-service",
    "metadata": {
      "tenantAware": true
    }
  }]
}
```

#### Service Broker Categories

There are 2 different categories of Service Brokers that can be implemented that way. They don't differ from an API perspective, but they treat bindings differently in their implementation.

- `single-tenant-aware`: For each tenant binding a specific configuration is done inside the tenant. It could e.g. provide an "OnPrem Connect" to a public cloud tenant. This configuration must be done for every tenant that is provided via a binding.
- `multi-tenant-aware`: Bindings are a configuration to make the service aware of tenants it can work with. An example for this is a "CI/CD" Service Broker. The CI/CD pipeline should be able to work on multiple tenants of a multi-cloud application. E.g. parts of the application are deployed to Azure, others to AWS. Especially for this type of Service Brokers not only tenants of the same meshProject must be selectable, but also tenants of other meshProjects in the same meshCustomer. E.g. the CI/CD pipeline should have access to dev, int and prod tenants, which might be located in different meshProjects. Providing those cross-project bindings can be achieved via [Service Instance Sharing](#sharable-service-instances).

#### Create Service Binding

When the service binding is created, meshMarketplace will provide a [Bind Resource object](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.15/spec.md#bind-resource-object) properties `tenant_id` and `platform` in the `bind_resource` object of the bind request:

```json
{
  "service_id": "my-service-id",
  "plan_id": "my-plan-id",
  "bind_resource": {
    "tenant_id": "my_tenant_id_1",
    "platform": "platform-identifier-1"
  }
}
```

- `tenant_id` is the tenant id in the platform, e.g. AWS Account ID or Azure Subscription Id.
- `platform` is the full identifier of the platform as it is configured in meshStack. It is custom per environment. The Service Broker team can request the list of available platforms and their identifier from meshcloud.

As a response the Service Broker will provide a credential binding. Depending on the service it might not be real credentials, but just a link to e.g. the CI/CD Web Interface. Or in case of the "OnPrem Connect" perhaps some metadata information for the user is provided. An empty object would also be a valid response. This credential information is only displayed to the user, so it should only contain information the user can understand.

#### Configuration in the meshMarketplace

Services can be platform-specific. A specific AWS OnPrem Connect SB is an example for this. It should only be possible to bind AWS tenants to this service. This can be achieved by [publishing](meshstack.meshmarketplace.development.md#publish-your-service-broker) this Service Broker only to marketplaces of AWS meshLocations. This will allow the user to only select tenants related to this meshLocation.

Multi-tenant-aware service brokers that support different platform types, should only be [published](meshstack.meshmarketplace.development.md#publish-your-service-broker) to the global location. This allows the user to select any tenant in the meshProject, independent of the meshLocation.

### Sharable Service Instances

[Service Instance Sharing](marketplace.service-instances.md#share-service-instance) must be activated by Service Broker via `shareable` flag on metadata of the service definition.

```json
{
  "services": [{
    "id": "acb56d7c-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-feb140a59a66",
    "name": "fake-service",
    "metadata": {
      "shareable": true
    }
  }]
}
```
