meshcloud can automatically provision Azure Subscriptions as Tenants for your [meshProjects](./meshcloud.project.md) and configure them according to your organiziations policies
using [Landing Zones](./meshcloud.landing-zones.md).

## Azure Portal

To access Azure Portal, navigate to your project in meshPanel, select your Azure Tenant and click the "Azure Portal" link.
Depending on the configuration implemented by your organization you should be automatically logged in on the Azure Portal
via meshcloud's Single-Sign On.

However, some configurations (i.e. due to MFA) can require you to sign in manually on the Azure Portal with your user credentials.
