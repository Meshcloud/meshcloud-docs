meshStack collects usage information from all your cloud platforms and provides central access to this. You get a detailed overview
about when and how long your resources were running and how much this costs.

## Tenant Usage Report

A tenant usage report provides usage information of one tenant (project representation in a specific platform). E.g. all resources like VMs, Storage, Public IPs, etc are shown in this report.

Tenant Usage Reports can be accessed from the Project Tenant screen via the menu entry "Usage Reports". For every period (e.g. a month),
a tenant usage report is created. You also have access to the current period (e.g. the current month), to always have full control of
your resources and their usage.

From a Tenant Usage Report you can also access a Detailed Report to see every single usage the resources created. That means you can e.g. see whether a resource was running for 3 hours, stopped for 5 hours and then started again for another 6 hours.

Partner accounts can access tenant usage reports for all their assigned meshCustomers in the Administration Area via "Platforms" -> "Usage Reports".

## Project Statement

These are summarized views on all your tenant usages per project. They can be used as an input to actually bill the resources. An overview of all different cloud
platforms used in the project is listed and additionally you also get the tenant usage reports listed below the overview. You can also access the previously described
Detailed Tenant Reports from here.

A chart in the project dashboard shows the total costs of the last project statements to get a quick overview of your project cost.

Customer Admins also have access to an overview of the Project Statements of all their projects in the Account Area via "Projects" -> "Project Statements". Also Partner accounts can access the project statements for all their assigned meshCustomers in the Administration Area via "Projects" -> "Project Statements".
