meshStack supports metering and billing for most common OpenStack versions. For fine-granular metering and best-performance, we recommend the use of OpenStack Panko for OpenStack Releases Pike and later.

## Prerequisites

- OpenStack admin user with suitable read-only permissions for all projects
- OpenStack APIs are accessible by meshStack metering collector components
- OpenStack Panko (optional, but recommended): OpenStack Pike or later
  - Panko must be configured to emit & record suitable events
  - note: Panko can also be used with suitable patches on older OpenStack releases
  - Contact us for details
