To manage Service Brokers that are available in the system go to the **Service Brokers** section of the **Administration** area.

All available Service Brokers are listed here, even the [private](meshstack.meshmarketplace.development.md#register-your-service-broker) ones. This provides administrators and partners with an overview about all Service Brokers in the system.

## Approve Service Broker

When a Customer [publishes](meshstack.meshmarketplace.development.md#publish-your-service-broker) a Service Broker, an administrator or partner has to approve the Service Broker first. To approve a Service Broker, the **check** button for the according Service Broker must be clicked. After approval, the services of the approved Service Broker will be available for all Users in the according Location's Marketplace.
