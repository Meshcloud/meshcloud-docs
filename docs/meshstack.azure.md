meshcloud can automatically provision Azure Subscriptions as Tenants for [meshProjects](./meshcloud.project.md) and configure them according to your organiziations policies
using [Landing Zones](./meshcloud.landing-zones.md).

## Integration Overview

To enable integration with Azure, operators need to deploy and configure the meshStack Azure Replicator. Operators can configure one or multiple `PlatformInstance`s of `PlatformType.Azure`. This makes Azure available to meshProjects like any other cloud platform in meshStack.

Azure relies on Azure Active Directoy (AAD) for authentication and authorization. meshcloud can seamlessly integrate with common
AAD setups like [Azure Hybrid Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/). Meshcloud helps you implement Azure in line with [Governance best-practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/governance-disciplines) by integrating [Blueprints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/overview) and Management Groups using [Landing Zones](#landing-zones)

In order to plan and execute a successful integration of Azure using meshcloud, organizations need to consider the following parts described in the sections below.

## Azure Active Directory Integration

All Subscriptions in Azure must be associated with exactly one AAD Tenant storing role and permission assignments. Azure uses this AAD Tenant to evaluate permissions on all resources contained in that subscription. meshcloud manages roles and assignments
by automatically replicating [meshProject Role Assignments](./meshcloud.project.md) to this AAD Tenant.

However, a key decision in any Azure integration is how your organization wants to provision user identities in this AAD Tenant.
Meshcloud supports two different ways to achieve this.

### Externally-provisioned Identities

The default model expected by Microsoft is [Hybrid Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/), i.e. a local Active Directory (AD) synced to Azure (Azure Active Directory, AAD). Organizations can implement this sync using
[Azure Active Directory Connect (AD Connect)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect). This sync populates user identities into an AAD Tenant owned by the organization and can also synchronize existing groups and memberships.

The user identities are synchronized to your organization's "home tenant", which also owns the email domains identifying these users.
In most organizations, other applications like Office 365 already consume user identities from this AAD Tenant.

> Please make sure that all users who need access to the Azure Portal are replicated into the AAD. meshcloud will issue
> a replication warning for projects that have role assignments that cannot be replicated because a user identity could not be found on the home tenant.

#### meshcloud AAD Tenant

Because meshcloud requires read-write permissions to manage user roles on Azure Subscriptions, we recommend creating a
separate "meshcloud AAD Tenant" to be exclusively used by meshcloud. Our orchestration engine then creates Guest Users in the meshcloud AAD Tenant that reference user identities from the "home tenant" (AAD B2B). This way, users have a single cloud identity managed
by your organization-wide policies while isolating "development" related Azure activies into its own AAD Tenant which has no
way of affecting other applications using the home tenant like Office 356 etc.

#### External User Id (euid)

Using [externally-provisioned user identities](./meshstack.identity-federation.md#externally-provisioned-identities) requires your IdP to provide a user identifier suitable to locate user identities
in the "home tenant". This external user id needs to be mapped to the `euid` user attribute in the [meshIdB](./meshstack.identity-federation.md).

It is important that the provided euid's are <b>case-sensitive</b> and must match the user entries saved in the AAD against which the replication should happen! This is a limitation imposed by the search queries of Microsoft Graph API.

> meshcloud can support complex Azure AD setups involving user identity lookup rules and multiple home tenants. Please contact our experts for more details.

### meshStack-provisioned Identities

In the [meshStack-provisioned Identities](./meshstack.identity-federation.md#meshstack-provisioned-identities) setup meshStack provisions user identities itself under a virtual domain in a "meshcloud AAD Tenant". This AAD tenant is then configured for federated authentication against [meshIdB](./meshstack.identity-federation.md).

This setup is useful for smaller organizations do not have existing AAD Tenants. We recommend large organizations use
externally-provisioned Identities that help ensure users have a single cloud identity with Microsoft Azure only.

### Licensing Considerations

Users managed in the meshcloud AAD Tenant do not require AAD Premium Licenses.

## meshcloud Service Principal

In order to manage user roles and permissions, meshcloud requires a Service Principal on the meshcloud AAD Tenant.
The Service Principal must be authorized in the scope of the meshcloud AAD Tenant.

1. Under **Azure Active Directory** &rarr; **App registrations** create a new web app (call it e.g. `meshReplicator`).
2. Add an client secret under **Certificates &amp; secrets** and write it down (it is the `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`).
3. Add the `Directory.ReadWriteAll`, `Group.ReadWriteAll` and `User.Read` permissions (application type) and click **Grant permissions**. You will also need to grant admin consent to your app. Therefore click **Grant admin consent** in the permissions screen.
4. Go to the App overview and write down the following: **Application (client) ID** (`SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_ID`), **Directory (tenant) ID** (`AAD_TENANT`, typically a `*.onmicrosoft.com` domain) and the **object id** (`SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_OBJECT_ID`).

Operators need to supply these variables to the [meshStack Configuration](#meshstack-configuration) for this Azure Platform Instance.

## Subscription Provisioning

To provide Azure Subscription for your organization's meshProjects, meshcloud supports using Enterprise Enrollment or allocating from a pool of externally-provisioned subscriptions.

### Using Enterprise Enrollment

meshcloud can automatically provision new subscriptions from an Enterprise Enrollment Account owned by your organization.

#### 1. Setting up the Enrollment Account

We recommend using dedicated enrollment accounts (EA) for exclusive use by meshcloud.

> EA Administrators must be careful to chose an EA Account Owner that's homed in the meshcloud AAD Tenant!

Subscriptions provisioned through the EA get automatically associated with the AAD Home-Tenant of the EA Account Owner.
If your organization uses Microsoft (i.e. outlook.com) identities as EA Account Owner, please invite the EA Owner user first into the meshcloud AAD Teant before creating the enrollment account.

To list your available EA accounts you can use the [`Get-AzEnrollmentAccount`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.billing/get-azenrollmentaccount?view=azps-2.6.0) powershell command:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-AzEnrollmentAccount

ObjectId                             PrincipalName
--------                             -------------
dbd8453d-071f-4fb4-8e01-c99f5b067649 jason@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
7ff524ac-a0de-4402-876f-934ccee3b601 carol@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```

After creating (or finding) a suitable EA Account, please note down the accounts object id as `EA_ACCOUNT_ID`.

#### 2. Authorizing the meshcloud Service Principal for EA

To use EA for Subscription provisioning, an EA Administrator must authorize the [meshcloud Service Principal](#meshcloud-service-principal) on the Enrollment Account [following the official instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/grant-access-to-create-subscription).

### Using a Pool of externally-provisioned Subscriptions

If your organization does not have access to an Enterprise Enrolment, you can alternatively configure meshcloud to
consume subscriptions from a pool of externally-provisioned subscriptions. This is useful for smaller organizations that whish
to use "Pay-as-you-go" subscriptions or if you're organization partners with an [Azure Cloud Solution Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-solution-provider/overview/azure-csp-overview) to provide your subscriptions.

The meshcloud Azure replication detects externally-provisioned subscriptions based on a configurable prefix in the subscription
name. Upon assignment to a meshProject, the subscription is inflated with the right [Landing Zone](#landing-zones) configuration
and removed from the subscription pool.

## Landing Zones

In Azure, a [Landing Zone](./meshcloud.landing-zones.md) is defined via a management group the subscription for the project will be assigned to. Policies can be applied
to these management groups. Optionally a blueprint can also be defined. Via an Azure Blueprint default resources can be deployed to the
subscription and additional specific policies can be defined. A blueprint can be configured to decline users to change or delete the
resources and policies created by the blueprint.

The landingzone can be configured in the `Administration` section. If a project is selected to have an Azure location a landingzone must be picked by the user. By choosing a landing zone platform specific configuration can be set (in this case for Azure). The options for Azure are:

### Management Group

All newly created meshProjects get their corresponding Subscription assigned to this [Management Group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/management-groups/). The Management Group can be configured by an platform operator throughout the Azure portal.

### Blueprint Name

The name of the [Blueprint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/overview) which should get assigned to the project. You can leave it empty, then no Blueprint will get automatically assigned.

### Blueprint Management Group

Blueprints must reside inside a Management Group. It is assumed it is in the same group as the group where to put the Subscriptions by default. If the Blueprint is located in another group it can be configuered here.

Operators must ensure to create these management groups in the meshcloud AAD Tenant before configuring them
for use in a Landing Zone.

### Max. Auto Upgrade Blueprint Version

Blueprints are versioned in Azure and can be managed via the Azure Portal. To avoid the accidental assignment of new (and possibly faulty) Blueprints there is this `Max. Auto Upgrade Blueprint Version` field. If you enter a version identifier here which corresponds to a existing Blueprint version in the Azure portal:

* Existing projects with this Landing Zone will get their Blueprint updated to this version on the next replication
* Newly created projects will get the latest Blueprint version assigned (possibly higher then the version configured here)

### Configuring Blueprint Automation

In order to assign [Blueprints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/overview) the meshcloud Azure replicator needs to be configured with the service principal id of the `Azure Blueprints` app
provided by Microsoft.

#### Finding the Azure Blueprints App Id

The `Azure Blueprints` service principal id is different in every AAD Tenant, so we need to find the id
of the app in the meshcloud AAD Tenant.

The easiest way to accomplish this is to start an Azure cloud shell in a subscription on the meshcloud AAD Tenant and execute the following command:

```powershell
PS Azure:\> Get-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId f71766dc-90d9-4b7d-bd9d-4499c4331c3f
```

The response should be similar to

```powershell
ServicePrincipalNames : {f71766dc-90d9-4b7d-bd9d-4499c4331c3f}
ApplicationId         : f71766dc-90d9-4b7d-bd9d-4499c4331c3f
ObjectType            : ServicePrincipal
DisplayName           : Azure Blueprints
Id                    : 227ac22a-************
```

Write down the Id as this is the `AZURE_BLUEPRINT_PRINCIPAL`.

#### Authorize the meshcloud Service Principal

You must must grant the meshcloud Service Principal `owner` access to all [management groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/) in the meshcloud AAD Tenant.

Before you can grant this access, you must have access to the root Management Group yourself. If you haven't already done so, please make sure your user is a `Global Administrator` on the meshcloud AAD Tenant
and has [elevated access to all management groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin).

> In case you're not able to see all management groups after elevating access, try signing out and back in to Azure Portal.

Once you have elevated access, use the Azure Portal to Navigate to the "Management Groups"  blade, then click on the "Details" link of the Tenant Root Group. Select "Access Control (IAM)" from the menu and create a Role assignment that grants the [App created above](#meshcloud-service-principal) for the meshcloud Service Principal (i.e. `meshReplicator`) the `Owner` permission on this resource.

In this screen you can also find the Object ID and Application ID of your service principal. In case you prefer the CLI and have the Azure CLI installed the following Powershell command can also reveal this ID for you:

```powershell
Get-AzADServicePrincipal | Where-Object {$_.Displayname -eq "<NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT>"}
```

## meshStack Configuration

With the information we gathered in the above section we now can configure the Azure Replicator.
This will typcially configured by your meshcloud experts, but please consult the following example as a reference
of possible configuration settings.
