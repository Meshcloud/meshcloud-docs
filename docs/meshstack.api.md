meshStack provides APIs that can be consumed by third-party applications. This allows the integration of meshStack into established company processes provided by other applications. A link to the API documentation can be found in every meshStack installation in the footer of meshPanel. It provides all details needed to use the API. You can find a deployed API documentation [here](https://federation.meshcloud.io/docs/index.html).
