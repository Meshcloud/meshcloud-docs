meshStack provides APIs that can be consumed by third-party applications. This allows the integration of meshStack into established company processes provided by other applications. The API documentation can be found in every meshStack installation in the footer of meshPanel. It provides all details needed to use the API. You can also find the deployed API documentation [here](https://federation.meshcloud.io/docs/index.html).
