Administrators can access performance analytics to get an overview of platform usage, users and meshProjects.

**Platform tenants**
: These charts show the current number of platform tenants per *platform instance*, *location* and *platform type*. Platform tenants are platform specific representations of [meshProjects](meshcloud.project.md#manage-meshprojects). Hover your mouse over segments to see specific numbers.
